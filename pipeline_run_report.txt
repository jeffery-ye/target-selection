Tpt1 performs a two-step reaction in which: (i) the 2\u2032-PO4 attacks NAD+ to form an RNA-2\u2032-phospho-(ADP-ribose) intermediate; and (ii) transesterification of the ADP-ribose O2\u2033 to the RNA 2\u2032-phosphodiester yields 2\u2032-OH RNA and ADP-ribose-1\u2033,2\u2033-cyclic phosphate. Because Tpt1 does not participate in metazoan tRNA splicing, and Tpt1 knockout has no apparent impact on mammalian physiology, Tpt1 is considered a potential antifungal drug target. Here we characterize Tpt1 enzymes from four human fungal pathogens: Coccidioides immitis, the agent of Valley Fever; Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, which cause invasive, often fatal, infections in immunocompromised hosts; and Candida auris, an emerging pathogen that is resistant to current therapies. All four pathogen Tpt1s were active in vivo in complementing a lethal Saccharomyces cerevisiae tpt1\u0394 mutation and in vitro in NAD+-dependent conversion of a 2\u2032-PO4 to a 2\u2032-OH. The fungal Tpt1s utilized nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide as a substrate in lieu of NAD+, albeit with much lower affinity, whereas nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide was ineffective. Fungal Tpt1s efficiently removed an internal ribonucleotide 2\u2032-phosphate from an otherwise all-DNA substrate. Replacement of an RNA ribose-2\u2032-PO4 nucleotide with arabinose-2\u2032-PO4 diminished enzyme specific activity by \u22652000-fold and selectively slowed step 2 of the reaction pathway, resulting in transient accumulation of an ara-2\u2032-phospho-ADP-ribosylated intermediate.

Self-splicing group II introns have emerged as promising drug targets, but their development has been limited by a lack of information on their distribution and architecture in pathogenic fungi. To meet this challenge, we developed a bioinformatic workflow for scanning sequence data to identify unique RNA structural signatures within group II introns. Using this approach, we discovered a set of ubiquitous introns within thermally dimorphic fungi (genera of Blastomyces, Coccidioides and Histoplasma). These introns are the most biochemically reactive group II introns ever reported, and they self-splice rapidly under near-physiological conditions without protein cofactors. Moreover, we demonstrated the small molecule targetability of these introns by showing that they can be inhibited by the FDA-approved drug mitoxantrone in vitro. Taken together, our results highlight the utility of structure-based informatic searches for identifying riboregulatory elements in pathogens, revealing a striking diversity of reactive self-splicing introns with great promise as antifungal drug targets.', 'is_open_access': True, 'full_text_url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/de466c7c0b42954c9e4c1e9b1f7555e2c5283539', 'relevance_score': 0.03}, {'doi': '10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003248', 'pmid': '33431378', 'title': 'Why onchocerciasis transmission persists after 15 annual ivermectin mass drug administrations in South-West Cameroon', 'abstract': 'Introduction Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination mainly with annual community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). High infection levels have been reported in South-West Cameroon, despite \u226515 years of CDTI. The aim of this study was to assess factors associated with continued onchocerciasis transmission and skin disease. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 in 20 communities in a loiasis-risk area in South-West Cameroon. A mixed-methods approach was used. Associations between infection levels, skin disease and adherence to CDTI were assessed using mixed regression modelling. Different community members’ perception and acceptability of the CDTI strategy was explored using semi-structured interviews. Results Onchocerciasis prevalence was 44.4% among 9456 participants. 17.5% of adults were systematic non-adherers and 5.9% participated in \u226575% of CDTI rounds. Skin disease affected 1/10 participants, including children. Increasing self-reported adherence to CDTI was associated with lower infection levels in participants aged \u226515 years but not in children. Adherence to CDTI was positively influenced by perceived health benefits, and negatively influenced by fear of adverse events linked with economic loss. Concern of lethal adverse events was a common reason for systematic non-adherence. Conclusion CDTI alone is unlikely to achieve elimination in those high transmission areas where low participation is commonly associated with the fear of adverse events, despite the current quasi absence of high-risk levels of loiasis. Such persisting historical memories and fear of ivermectin might impact adherence to CDTI also in areas with historical presence but current absence of loiasis. Because such issues are unlikely to be tackled by CDTI adaptive measures, alternative strategies are needed for onchocerciasis elimination where negative perception of ivermectin is an entrenched barrier to community participation in programmes.', 'is_open_access': True, 'full_text_url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/64fc1b391ea9220342033e2ecf345533637549b7', 'relevance_score': 0.24}, {'doi': '10.1093/aje/kwab136', 'pmid': '33972995', 'title': 'Transportability from Randomized Trials to Clinical Care: On Initial HIV Treatment with Efavirenz and Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors.', 'abstract': 'Efavirenz was associated with increased suicidal thoughts/behaviors in an analysis of randomized trials. However, analyses of observational data have found no evidence of increased hazard. To assess whether population differences explain this divergence we transported the effect of efavirenz from these trials to a specific target population. Using inverse odds weights and multiple imputation, the effect of efavirenz on suicidal thoughts/behaviors in these randomized trials (enrolled 2001-2007) was transported to a trials-eligible cohort of adults in the United States initiating antiretroviral therapy while receiving HIV clinical care at medical centers between 1999-2015. Overall, 8,291 cohort and 3,949 trial participants were eligible. Antidepressant prescription (19% vs. 13%) and injection drug history (16% vs. 10%) were more frequent in the cohort versus trials. Compared to the effect in trials, the estimated hazard ratio for efavirenz on suicidal thoughts/behaviors was attenuated in our target population (trials=2.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 4.4; transported=1.8, 95%CI: 0.90, 4.4), whereas the incidence rate difference was similar (trials=5.1, 95%CI: 1.6, 8.7; transported=5.4, 95%CI: -0.4, 11.4).

It is characterized by several neurological symptoms and the appearance of acanthocytes. Elevated tyrosine kinase Lyn activity has been recently identified as one of the key pathophysiological mechanisms in this disease, and therefore represents a promising drug target. Methods: We evaluated an individual off-label treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (100 mg/d, 25.8–50.4 weeks) of three ChAc patients. Alongside thorough safety monitoring, we assessed motor and non-motor scales (e.g., MDS-UPDRS, UHDRS, quality of life) as well as routine and experimental laboratory parameters (e.g., serum neurofilament, Lyn kinase activity, actin cytoskeleton in red blood cells). Results: Dasatinib appeared to be reasonably safe. The clinical parameters remained stable without significant improvement or deterioration. Regain of deep tendon reflexes was observed in one patient. Creatine kinase, serum neurofilament levels, and acanthocyte count did not reveal consistent effects. However, a reduction of initially elevated Lyn kinase activity and accumulated autophagy markers, as well as a partial restoration of the actin cytoskeleton, was found in red blood cells. Conclusions: We report on the first treatment approach with disease-modifying intention in ChAc. The experimental parameters indicate target engagement in red blood cells, while clinical effects on the central nervous system could not be proven within a rather short treatment time. Limited knowledge on the natural history of ChAc and the lack of appropriate biomarkers remain major barriers for “clinical trial readiness”. We suggest a panel of outcome parameters for future clinical trials in ChAc.', 'is_open_access': True, 'full_text_url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01e24b70f9f5bdb1b3fc0df5535767886203850e', 'relevance_score': 0.11}, {'doi': None, 'pmid': None, 'title': 'OncoEnrichR: cancer-dedicated gene set interpretation', 'abstract': 'Genome-scale screening experiments in cancer produce long lists of candidate genes that require extensive interpretation for biological insight and prioritization for follow-up studies. Interrogation of gene lists frequently represents a significant and time-consuming undertaking, in which experimental biologists typically combine results from a variety of bioinformatics resources in an attempt to portray and understand cancer relevance. As a means to simplify and strengthen the support for this endeavor, we have developed oncoEnrichR, a flexible bioinformatics tool that allows cancer researchers to comprehensively interrogate a given gene list along multiple facets of cancer relevance. oncoEnrichR differs from general gene set analysis frameworks through the integration of an extensive set of prior knowledge specifically relevant for cancer, including ranked gene-tumor type associations, literature-supported proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene annotations, target druggability data, regulatory interactions, synthetic lethality predictions, as well as prognostic associations, gene aberrations, and co-expression patterns across tumor types. The software produces a structured and user-friendly analysis report as its main output, where versions of all underlying data resources are explicitly logged, the latter being a critical component for reproducible science. We demonstrate the usefulness of oncoEnrichR through interrogation of two candidate lists from proteomic and CRISPR screens. oncoEnrichR is freely available as a web-based workflow hosted by the Galaxy platform (https://oncotools.elixir.no), and can also be accessed as a stand-alone R package (https://github.com/sigven/oncoEnrichR).', 'is_open_access': False, 'full_text_url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/605187ba8043a7fdbf3d08b425fa2a4e2dbd8b09', 'relevance_score': 0.01}]
