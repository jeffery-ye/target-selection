  Title:         Activity and substrate specificity of Candida, Aspergillus, and Coccidioides Tpt1: essential tRNA splicing enzymes and potential antifungal targets
  Abstract:      The enzyme Tpt1 is an essential agent of fungal tRNA splicing that removes an internal RNA 2\u2032-PO4 generated by fungal tRNA ligase. Tpt1 performs a two-step reaction in which: (i) the 2\u2032-PO4 attacks NAD+ to form an RNA-2\u2032-phospho-(ADP-ribose) intermediate; and (ii) transesterification of the ADP-ribose O2\u2033 to the RNA 2\u2032-phosphodiester yields 2\u2032-OH RNA and ADP-ribose-1\u2033,2\u2033-cyclic phosphate. Because Tpt1 does not participate in metazoan tRNA splicing, and Tpt1 knockout has no apparent impact on mammalian physiology, Tpt1 is considered a potential antifungal drug target. Here we characterize Tpt1 enzymes from four human fungal pathogens: Coccidioides immitis, the agent of Valley Fever; Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, which cause invasive, often fatal, infections in immunocompromised hosts; and Candida auris, an emerging pathogen that is resistant to current therapies. All four pathogen Tpt1s were active in vivo in complementing a lethal Saccharomyces cerevisiae tpt1\u0394 mutation and in vitro in NAD+-dependent conversion of a 2\u2032-PO4 to a 2\u2032-OH. The fungal Tpt1s utilized nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide as a substrate in lieu of NAD+, albeit with much lower affinity, whereas nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide was ineffective. Fungal Tpt1s efficiently removed an internal ribonucleotide 2\u2032-phosphate from an otherwise all-DNA substrate. Replacement of an RNA ribose-2\u2032-PO4 nucleotide with arabinose-2\u2032-PO4 diminished enzyme specific activity by \u22652000-fold and selectively slowed step 2 of the reaction pathway, resulting in transient accumulation of an ara-2\u2032-phospho-ADP-ribosylated intermediate. Our results implicate the 2\u2032-PO4 ribonucleotide as the principal determinant of fungal Tpt1 nucleic acid substrate specificity.

  Title:         A Case for Two-Component Signaling Systems As Antifungal Drug Targets
  Abstract:      The recent outbreak of fungal meningitis caused by Exserohilum rostratum in patients receiving contaminated steroid injections resulted in 64 deaths, receiving a lot of press and briefly bringing into the public eye the difficulty of treating systemic fungal infections [1]. What is generally less well appreciated, however, is that there are several other, much more common fungal pathogens that pose a serious health threat. Indeed, currently more people die from these fungal diseases worldwide than from tuberculosis or malaria [2]. The fungal pathogens most frequently responsible for human mortality are: Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida spp. (predominantly C. albicans), Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii, and dimorphic fungi that cause endemic mycoses (Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitides, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis). Fungal pathogens pose an especially high risk to individuals with compromised immunity, and this population of susceptible hosts is growing [3,4]. There has been a steady increase in the incidence of fungal infections over recent decades, primarily due to the AIDS pandemic, an increase in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplants, a higher incidence of seriously ill patients in intensive care units, and the aging of the human population [3�8]. Despite the extensive list of fungal pathogens and the increasing frequency of their occurrence, we have at our disposal only a very limited number of antifungal drugs. The past two decades have seen the emergence of two classes of antifungals: those that target ergosterol synthesis (the azoles) and those that target cell wall \u03b2-1,3 glucan synthase (echinocandins). Of the azoles, the triazoles have gained importance as alternatives to the more toxic amphotericin B. Triazoles are fungistatic and their continued use has resulted in an increase in triazole resistance among formerly sensitive species and a rising number of disease cases caused by intrinsically azole-resistant non-albicans Candida species [4]. Echinocandins are fungicidal and are the drug of choice for treating most fungal infections, but these drugs are not effective in treating infections caused by C. neoformans, and echinocandin resistance is increasing in some Candida species [9]. Clearly, there is an urgent need to discover new drug targets to meet the challenges posed by fungal infections.

  Title:         Decoding Transcription Regulatory Mechanisms Associated with Coccidioides immitis Phase Transition Using Total RNA
  Abstract:      Infectious pathogens like airborne viruses or fungal spores are difficult to study; they require high-containment facilities, special equipment, and expertise. As such, establishing approaches such as genome editing or other means to identify the factors and mechanisms underlying caused diseases, and, thus, promising drug targets, is costly and time-intensive. ABSTRACT New or emerging infectious diseases are commonly caused by pathogens that cannot be readily manipulated or studied under common laboratory conditions. These limitations hinder standard experimental approaches and our abilities to define the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. The advance of capped small RNA sequencing (csRNA-seq) now enables genome-wide mapping of actively initiated transcripts from genes and other regulatory transcribed start regions (TSRs) such as enhancers at a precise moment from total RNA. As RNA is nonpathogenic and can be readily isolated from inactivated infectious samples, csRNA-seq can detect acute changes in gene regulation within or in response to a pathogen with remarkable sensitivity under common laboratory conditions. Studying valley fever (coccidioidomycosis), an emerging endemic fungal infection that increasingly impacts livestock, pet, and human health, we show how csRNA-seq can unravel transcriptional programs driving pathogenesis. Performing csRNA-seq on RNA isolated from different stages of the valley fever pathogen Coccidioides immitis revealed alternative promoter usage, connected cis-regulatory domains, and a WOPR family transcription factor, which are known regulators of virulence in other fungi, as being critical for pathogenic growth. We further demonstrate that a C. immitis WOPR homologue, CIMG_02671, activates transcription in a WOPR motif-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into valley fever pathogenesis and provide a proof of principle for csRNA-seq as a powerful means to determine the genes, regulatory mechanisms, and transcription factors that control the pathogenesis of highly infectious agents. IMPORTANCE Infectious pathogens like airborne viruses or fungal spores are difficult to study; they require high-containment facilities, special equipment, and expertise. As such, establishing approaches such as genome editing or other means to identify the factors and mechanisms underlying caused diseases, and, thus, promising drug targets, is costly and time-intensive. These obstacles particularly hinder the analysis of new, emerging, or rare infectious diseases. We recently developed a method termed capped small RNA sequencing (csRNA-seq) that enables capturing acute changes in active gene expression from total RNA. Prior to csRNA-seq, such an analysis was possible only by using living cells or nuclei, in which pathogens are highly infectious. The process of RNA purification, however, inactivates pathogens and thus enables the analysis of gene expression during disease progression under standard laboratory conditions. As a proof of principle, here, we use csRNA-seq to unravel the gene regulatory programs and factors likely critical for the pathogenesis of valley fever, an emerging endemic fungal infection that increasingly impacts livestock, pet, and human health.

  Title:         Genomic Data Mining Reveals Abundant Uncharacterized Transporters in Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii
  Abstract:      Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii are causative agents of coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Valley Fever. The increasing Valley Fever cases in the past decades, the expansion of endemic regions, and the rising azole drug-resistant strains have underscored an urgent need for a better understanding of Coccidioides biology and new antifungal strategies. Transporters play essential roles in pathogen survival, growth, infection, and adaptation, and are considered as potential drug targets. However, the composition and roles of transport machinery in Coccidioides remain largely unknown. In this study, genomic data mining revealed an abundant, uncharacterized repertoire of transporters in Coccidioides genomes. The catalog included 1288 and 1235 transporter homologs in C. immitis and C. posadasii, respectively. They were further annotated to class, subclass, family, subfamily and range of substrates based on the Transport Classification (TC) system. They may play diverse roles in nutrient uptake, metabolite secretion, ion homeostasis, drug efflux, or signaling. This study represents an initial effort for a systems-level characterization of the transport machinery in these understudied fungal pathogens.

  Title:         Characterization of the tRNA ligases of pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides immitis
  Abstract:      Yeast tRNA ligase (Trl1) is an essential trifunctional enzyme that repairs RNA breaks with 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic-PO4 and 5\u2032-OH ends. Trl1 is composed of C-terminal cyclic phosphodiesterase and central polynucleotide kinase domains that heal the broken ends to generate the 3\u2032-OH, 2\u2032-PO4, and 5\u2032-PO4 termini required for sealing by an N-terminal ligase domain. Trl1 enzymes are found in all human fungal pathogens and they are promising targets for antifungal drug discovery because: (i) their domain structures and biochemical mechanisms are unique compared to the mammalian RtcB-type tRNA splicing enzyme; and (ii) there are no obvious homologs of the Trl1 ligase domain in mammalian proteomes. Here we characterize the tRNA ligases of two human fungal pathogens: Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus. The biological activity of CimTrl1 and AfuTrl1 was verified by showing that their expression complements a Saccharomyces cerevisiae trl1\u0394 mutant. Purified recombinant AfuTrl1 and CimTrl1 proteins were catalytically active in joining 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic-PO4 and 5\u2032-OH ends in vitro, either as full-length proteins or as a mixture of separately produced healing and sealing domains. The biochemical properties of CimTrl1 and AfuTrl1 are similar to those of budding yeast Trl1, particularly with respect to their preferential use of GTP as the phosphate donor for the polynucleotide kinase reaction. Our findings provide genetic and biochemical tools to screen for inhibitors of tRNA ligases from pathogenic fungi.

  Title:         Proteomic Analysis of Pathogenic Fungi Reveals Highly Expressed Conserved Cell Wall Proteins
  Abstract:      We are presenting a quantitative proteomics tally of the most commonly expressed conserved fungal proteins of the cytosol, the cell wall, and the secretome. It was our goal to identify fungi-typical proteins that do not share significant homology with human proteins. Such fungal proteins are of interest to the development of vaccines or drug targets. Protein samples were derived from 13 fungal species, cultured in rich or in minimal media; these included clinical isolates of Aspergillus, Candida, Mucor, Cryptococcus, and Coccidioides species. Proteomes were analyzed by quantitative MSE (Mass Spectrometry�Elevated Collision Energy). Several thousand proteins were identified and quantified in total across all fractions and culture conditions. The 42 most abundant proteins identified in fungal cell walls or supernatants shared no to very little homology with human proteins. In contrast, all but five of the 50 most abundant cytosolic proteins had human homologs with sequence identity averaging 59%. Proteomic comparisons of the secreted or surface localized fungal proteins highlighted conserved homologs of the Aspergillus fumigatus proteins 1,3-\u03b2-glucanosyltransferases (Bgt1, Gel1-4), Crf1, Ecm33, EglC, and others. The fact that Crf1 and Gel1 were previously shown to be promising vaccine candidates, underlines the value of the proteomics data presented here.

  Title:         Candida Vajinitinin Tedavisinde Otesekonazol (VT-1161): G�ncel Durum
  Abstract:      Antifungal drugs used for the treatment of fungal infections have a high risk of drug-drug interactions and side effects (such as hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity). Therefore, the search for novel antifungal drugs continues. Azole antifungals are among the most preferred drug classes in the treatment of invasive and mucosal fungal infections. This group of drugs targets lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase, which is responsible for the synthesis of ergosterol in the structure of the fungal cell membrane. However, their use is limited, as they also interact with human cytochrome enzymes. Oteseconazole (VT-1161) is a new-generation antifungal drug class of tetrazole. It causes fewer drug-drug interactions and side effects, as it acts by selectively binding to the fungal cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51). Studies have also shown that VT-1161 is effective against fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans and Candida krusei, echinocandin-resistant Candida glabrata, dermatophytes, Cryptococcus, Rhizopus, and Coccidioides species. Candida vaginitis (CV) is an important problem with an increasing prevalence globally. VT-1161 is characterized by high oral bioavailability, a long plasma half-life (> 48 hours), and effective penetration into the vaginal mucosa. This review presents up-to-date information on the spectrum activity of oteseconazole and in vivo and in vitro data. Considering the limited treatment options for acute and recurrent CV, VT-1161 seems to be a safe and effective option.

  Title:         Discovery of highly reactive self-splicing group II introns within the mitochondrial genomes of human pathogenic fungi
  Abstract:      Abstract Fungal pathogens represent an expanding global health threat for which treatment options are limited. Self-splicing group II introns have emerged as promising drug targets, but their development has been limited by a lack of information on their distribution and architecture in pathogenic fungi. To meet this challenge, we developed a bioinformatic workflow for scanning sequence data to identify unique RNA structural signatures within group II introns. Using this approach, we discovered a set of ubiquitous introns within thermally dimorphic fungi (genera of Blastomyces, Coccidioides and Histoplasma). These introns are the most biochemically reactive group II introns ever reported, and they self-splice rapidly under near-physiological conditions without protein cofactors. Moreover, we demonstrated the small molecule targetability of these introns by showing that they can be inhibited by the FDA-approved drug mitoxantrone in vitro. Taken together, our results highlight the utility of structure-based informatic searches for identifying riboregulatory elements in pathogens, revealing a striking diversity of reactive self-splicing introns with great promise as antifungal drug targets.

  Title:         Review of the novel antifungal drug olorofim (F901318)
  Abstract:      There is clearly a need for novel antifungal agents, not only concerning spectrum, but also oral bioavailability, tolerability, and drug-drug interactions. There is growing concern for antifungal resistance for current available antifungals, mainly driven by environmental fungicide use or long-term exposure to antifungals, in the setting of mould-active prophylaxis or for chronic antifungal infections, such as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Moreover, the incidence of breakthrough infections is increasing, because of the introduction of (mould-active) prophylaxis (1-4). There is emergence of difficult to treat invasive fungal infections, such as those caused by Lomentospora prolificans, cryptic species of Aspergillus, Scedosporium and Coccidioides. Olorofim (F901318) is the first-in class of the orotomides, a novel antifungal class targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines. Olorofim shows good in vitro and in vivo activity against Aspergillus species, rare and difficult to treat moulds and endemic dimorphic fungi, including azole- and amphotericin-resistant isolates. It lacks activity against yeasts and the Mucorales species. It is only orally available and shows very promising results in ongoing clinical trials. In this review we will describe the mechanism of action of olorofim, the spectrum of activity in vitro and in vivo, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions, resistance, and clinical outcomes.

  Title:         Base editing screens define the genetic landscape of cancer drug resistance mechanisms
  Abstract:      Drug resistance is a principal limitation to the long-term efficacy of cancer therapies. Cancer genome sequencing can retrospectively delineate the genetic basis of drug resistance, but this requires large numbers of post-treatment samples to nominate causal variants. Here we prospectively identify genetic mechanisms of resistance to ten oncology drugs from CRISPR base editing mutagenesis screens in four cancer cell lines using a guide RNA library predicted to install 32,476 variants in 11 cancer genes. We identify four functional classes of protein variants modulating drug sensitivity and use single-cell transcriptomics to reveal how these variants operate through distinct mechanisms, including eliciting a drug-addicted cell state. We identify variants that can be targeted with alternative inhibitors to overcome resistance and functionally validate an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) variant that sensitizes lung cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors. Our variant-to-function map has implications for patient stratification, therapy combinations and drug scheduling in cancer treatment. Base editing screens of 11 cancer genes identify four functional classes of variants that collectively underpin sensitivity and resistance to ten commonly used drugs in cancer cell lines.
