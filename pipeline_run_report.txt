  DOI:            10.1261/rna.078660.120
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly states that the enzyme Tpt1 is 'considered a potential antifungal drug target' and characterizes its function in Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus.

  DOI:            10.1371/journal.ppat.1004632
  Classification: unclear
  Reasoning:      This is a review article highlighting the urgent need for new antifungal drug targets and mentioning relevant fungal pathogens, but it does not identify or characterize a specific new target.

  DOI:            10.1128/msystems.01404-21
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly identifies a 'WOPR family transcription factor' (CIMG_02671) as being 'critical for pathogenic growth' in Coccidioides immitis and refers to the findings as providing 'promising drug targets.'

2025-11-08 18:08:26,135 - INFO - 
  DOI:            10.3390/jof8101064
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly states that 'Transporters... are considered as potential drug targets' and then proceeds to characterize a large repertoire of these transporters in Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii.

  DOI:            10.1261/rna.057455.116
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly identifies tRNA ligases (Trl1) as 'promising targets for antifungal drug discovery' and characterizes them in Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus.

  DOI:            10.3390/jof2010006
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly states its goal is to identify 'fungi-typical proteins that do not share significant homology with human proteins' that are 'of interest to the development of vaccines or drug targets' and highlights specific proteins (e.g., 1,3-\u03b2-glucanosyltransferases, Crf1, Gel1) from Aspergillus and Coccidioides species.

  DOI:            10.54453/tmcd.2022.36024
  Classification: false
  Reasoning:      This is a review of an existing antifungal drug (Oteseconazole) and its known target (fungal CYP51), rather than the discovery or characterization of a new potential drug target in Coccidioides or Aspergillus.

  DOI:            10.1093/nar/gkab1077
  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly states that 'Self-splicing group II introns have emerged as promising drug targets' and identifies such introns in Coccidioides, demonstrating their small molecule targetability and concluding they have 'great promise as antifungal drug targets.'

  DOI:            10.1186/s12879-024-10143-3
  Classification: false
  Reasoning:      This is a review of an emerging antifungal drug (Olorofim) and its known target (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, DHODH), rather than the discovery or characterization of a new potential drug target in Coccidioides or Aspergillus.

2025-11-08 18:08:26,137 - INFO - 
  DOI:            10.1038/s41588-024-01948-8
  Classification: false
  Reasoning:      This abstract is about drug resistance mechanisms in cancer therapies and does not relate to fungal drug, vaccine, or antifungal targets in Coccidioides or Aspergillus.
