  Title:         Activity and substrate specificity of Candida, Aspergillus, and Coccidioides Tpt1: essential tRNA splicing enzymes and potential antifungal targets
  Abstract:      The enzyme Tpt1 is an essential agent of fungal tRNA splicing that removes an internal RNA 2\u2032-PO4 generated by fungal tRNA ligase. Tpt1 performs a two-step reaction in which: (i) the 2\u2032-PO4 attacks NAD+ to form an RNA-2\u2032-phospho-(ADP-ribose) intermediate; and (ii) transesterification of the ADP-ribose O2\u2033 to the RNA 2\u2032-phosphodiester yields 2\u2032-OH RNA and ADP-ribose-1\u2033,2\u2033-cyclic phosphate. Because Tpt1 does not participate in metazoan tRNA splicing, and Tpt1 knockout has no apparent impact on mammalian physiology, Tpt1 is considered a potential antifungal drug target. Here we characterize Tpt1 enzymes from four human fungal pathogens: Coccidioides immitis, the agent of Valley Fever; Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, which cause invasive, often fatal, infections in immunocompromised hosts; and Candida auris, an emerging pathogen that is resistant to current therapies. All four pathogen Tpt1s were active in vivo in complementing a lethal Saccharomyces cerevisiae tpt1\u0394 mutation and in vitro in NAD+-dependent conversion of a 2\u2032-PO4 to a 2\u2032-OH. The fungal Tpt1s utilized nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide as a substrate in lieu of NAD+, albeit with much lower affinity, whereas nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide was ineffective. Fungal Tpt1s efficiently removed an internal ribonucleotide 2\u2032-phosphate from an otherwise all-DNA substrate. Replacement of an RNA ribose-2\u2032-PO4 nucleotide with arabinose-2\u2032-PO4 diminished enzyme specific activity by \u22652000-fold and selectively slowed step 2 of the reaction pathway, resulting in transient accumulation of an ara-2\u2032-phospho-ADP-ribosylated intermediate. Our results implicate the 2\u2032-PO4 ribonucleotide as the principal determinant of fungal Tpt1 nucleic acid substrate specificity.

  Title:         A Case for Two-Component Signaling Systems As Antifungal Drug Targets
  Abstract:      The recent outbreak of fungal meningitis caused by Exserohilum rostratum in patients receiving contaminated steroid injections resulted in 64 deaths, receiving a lot of press and briefly bringing into the public eye the difficulty of treating systemic fungal infections [1]. What is generally less well appreciated, however, is that there are several other, much more common fungal pathogens that pose a serious health threat. Indeed, currently more people die from these fungal diseases worldwide than from tuberculosis or malaria [2]. The fungal pathogens most frequently responsible for human mortality are: Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida spp. (predominantly C. albicans), Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii, and dimorphic fungi that cause endemic mycoses (Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitides, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis). Fungal pathogens pose an especially high risk to individuals with compromised immunity, and this population of susceptible hosts is growing [3,4]. There has been a steady increase in the incidence of fungal infections over recent decades, primarily due to the AIDS pandemic, an increase in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplants, a higher incidence of seriously ill patients in intensive care units, and the aging of the human population [3–8]. Despite the extensive list of fungal pathogens and the increasing frequency of their occurrence, we have at our disposal only a very limited number of antifungal drugs. The past two decades have seen the emergence of two classes of antifungals: those that target ergosterol synthesis (the azoles) and those that target cell wall \u03b2-1,3 glucan synthase (echinocandins). Of the azoles, the triazoles have gained importance as alternatives to the more toxic amphotericin B. Triazoles are fungistatic and their continued use has resulted in an increase in triazole resistance among formerly sensitive species and a rising number of disease cases caused by intrinsically azole-resistant non-albicans Candida species [4]. Echinocandins are fungicidal and are the drug of choice for treating most fungal infections, but these drugs are not effective in treating infections caused by C. neoformans, and echinocandin resistance is increasing in some Candida species [9]. Clearly, there is an urgent need to discover new drug targets to meet the challenges posed by fungal infections.

  Classification: true
  Reasoning:      The abstract explicitly identifies Tpt1 as a 'potential antifungal drug target' and characterizes its function in Coccidioides immitis and Aspergillus fumigatus.

  Classification: unclear
  Reasoning:      The abstract discusses the urgent need for new antifungal drug targets due to increasing resistance and mentions Coccidioides and Aspergillus. However, it does not propose or investigate any specific drug target itself; it is a general review of the problem.
