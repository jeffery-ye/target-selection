  Title:         Computational Approaches for Discovering Virulence Factors in Coccidioides
  Abstract:      Emerging respiratory dimorphic fungi, including Coccidioides, pose a growing public health threat due to their ability to cause severe disease and the limited therapeutic options. A growing gap exists between rapidly expanding computational data and slower traditional experimental methods for virulence factor identification, limiting progress in fungal pathogenesis research and therapeutic development. This review presents a framework for integrating computational and experimental methodologies to accelerate virulence discovery in Coccidioides. We examine predictive tools for adhesins, transporters, secreted effectors, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and secondary metabolites, plus therapeutic target prioritization strategies based on druggability, selectivity, essentiality, and precedent. Examples from Coccidioides and other World Health Organization-designated emerging fungi highlight how computational pipelines clarify pathogenic mechanisms and guide experimental design. We also assess machine learning, structural prediction, and reverse vaccinology approaches for enhance target discovery. By applying computational advances to Coccidioides research with experimental validation, this integrated approach can guide future antifungal drug and vaccine development.

  Title:         Coccidioidomycosis: Changing Concepts and Knowledge Gaps
  Abstract:      Although first described more than 120 years ago, much remains unknown about coccidioidomycosis. In this review, new information that has led to changing concepts will be reviewed and remaining gaps in our knowledge will be discussed. In particular, new ideas regarding ecology and epidemiology, problems and promises of diagnosis, controversies over management, and the possibility of a vaccine will be covered.

  Title:         Comparative genomics allowed the identification of drug targets against human fungal pathogens
  Abstract:      BackgroundThe prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased steadily worldwide in the last few decades. Particularly, there has been a global rise in the number of infections among immunosuppressed people. These patients present severe clinical forms of the infections, which are commonly fatal, and they are more susceptible to opportunistic fungal infections than non-immunocompromised people. IFIs have historically been associated with high morbidity and mortality, partly because of the limitations of available antifungal therapies, including side effects, toxicities, drug interactions and antifungal resistance. Thus, the search for alternative therapies and/or the development of more specific drugs is a challenge that needs to be met. Genomics has created new ways of examining genes, which open new strategies for drug development and control of human diseases.ResultsIn silico analyses and manual mining selected initially 57 potential drug targets, based on 55 genes experimentally confirmed as essential for Candida albicans or Aspergillus fumigatus and other 2 genes (kre2 and erg6) relevant for fungal survival within the host. Orthologs for those 57 potential targets were also identified in eight human fungal pathogens (C. albicans, A. fumigatus, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Paracoccidioides lutzii, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum). Of those, 10 genes were present in all pathogenic fungi analyzed and absent in the human genome. We focused on four candidates: trr1 that encodes for thioredoxin reductase, rim8 that encodes for a protein involved in the proteolytic activation of a transcriptional factor in response to alkaline pH, kre2 that encodes for \u03b1-1,2-mannosyltransferase and erg6 that encodes for \u0394(24)-sterol C-methyltransferase.ConclusionsOur data show that the comparative genomics analysis of eight fungal pathogens enabled the identification of four new potential drug targets. The preferred profile for fungal targets includes proteins conserved among fungi, but absent in the human genome. These characteristics potentially minimize toxic side effects exerted by pharmacological inhibition of the cellular targets. From this first step of post-genomic analysis, we obtained information relevant to future new drug development.

  Reasoning:      This is a review article discussing computational and experimental frameworks for accelerating virulence discovery and therapeutic target prioritization in Coccidioides. While it is highly relevant to target identification, it does not present novel drug targets from its own research, but rather methodologies for finding them. The full text may contain specific targets, but the abstract does not explicitly state them as findings of this particular study.
